## Contributing
When working on this repo, please either claim an existing issue or create a new one. If you would like to claim this 
issue, comment on it so that I can assign you. Or, if you have access, go ahead and assign yourself.

If you are not a collaborator, you should fork this repo and make these changes on your fork.

When working on a feature, create a new branch from main and give your branch a name that lets us know what that branch
is for. I.e, if claiming an issue `Add tests for stock class`, you could name the branch `testing/stock-class`. If adding
a new feature, such as a new api request, you could name it `feature/get-price-history`.

**Always be sure to lint before you push**, this will be enforced in the near future, but for now is on the honor system.


Commit often with good commit messages. Your commits should at least include a good title, but should also have a body
to describe what was changed and why.

After you push to the repo (your fork, if you are not a collaborator), create a pull request to main on our repo
(the original repo).
